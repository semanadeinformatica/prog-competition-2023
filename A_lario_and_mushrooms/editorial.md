## Unbridged problem statement

Given the weight of a mushroom, output its category given the following criteria:

- The mushroom is a "Mega Mushroom" if `1900 <= weight`;
- The mushroom is a "Super Mushroom": `1500 <= weight <= 1899`;
- The mushroom is a "Regular Mushroom": `1000 <= weight <= 1499`;
- Mini Mushroom: `weight <= 999`.

## Solution

To solve this problem we should use "if" and "else" statements to output the correct string depending on the weight of the mushroom.
